| The game
	The game is maintained by the main game while loop, which iterates as long as the
	render window is open and the player has not chosen [EXIT] option in the menu.
	In each iteration it processes the player's input, checks for frame time (minimal is 1/60s),
	if the game isn't paused it updates the position of all game objects (entities and projectiles)
	and then renders everything to the render window.

	The update() method moves the player, all entities and projectiles and then checks for collisions
	between objects and deals with them, in the end the method call level progression manager and checks
	if the current level has been completed and if so, starts a new one.

	The game is terminated when the player wins, loses, closes the window or choses the [EXIT] option
	in the menu. (For debugging purposes, the HOME key will exit the game aswell.)

	The game is won when the update() method recieves a positive answer on emptiness of the enemy vector
	in the last room, it is lost if the player's health reaches 0.
