| Goal of the game
	In the starting room, there are three portals, if the portal
	is blue, it is enterable, if it is green, that wing is complete
	and if it is red, that wind is not unlocked yet.
	In each wing, accessed by it's respective portal, are two rooms.
	In the first room, there will be several enemies called 'Blobs',
	after you defeat them, the portal to the boss' room will apear.
	When you manage to beat the boss, next wing will unlock, the main
	goal of the game is to beat you way to the boss of the north wing,
	called Dr Thomas Holly, and beat him.

| Blobs
	West wing:
		These blobs will try to charge at you (turning red and increasing
		their speed aswell as locking their direction to your last position).
	East wing:
		These stationary blobs will be in the corners of the room and shoot
		randomly in one of 5 directions to the inside of the room.
	North wing:
		These blobs will move in a square, whilst shooting low-damage projectiles
		but at a faster rate than any other.

| Bosses
	West wing:
		[Dr Forstix] This boss shares similar strategy to the west wing's blobs
		as he will try to charge at you, although his charges will be faster and
		longet in trajectory length.
	East wing:
		[Doc Topferino] This boss will teleport (clockwise) between 4 points that
		form corners of a square, whilst shooting at you in a simillar manner to
		the east wing's blobs.
	North wing:
		[Dr Holly] This boss moves from left to right behind an invisible wall,
		that can be penetrated only by his or your projectiles.
