***Dr Holly***
<br>Note: This was added as an already finished project for possible future additions.
<br>This was my first C++, my first SFML and my first big project, so the code style,
<br>used methods and the usage of C++ std containers are very basic and simple.
<br><br>
****TODO:****
01. Clean up the code.
02. Add C++11 features.
03. Change that horrible song.
