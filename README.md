***Dr Holly***
<br>Note1: This was added as an already finished project for possible future additions.
<br>This was my first C++, my first SFML and my first big project, so the code style,
<br>used methods and the usage of C++ std containers are very basic and simple.
<br>Note2: {+FOLD} and {-FOLD} were my folding markers for vim before I started to
<br>use syntax folding (or indent folding for python). Can easily be removed via substitute
<br>to empty string using regexps.

***TODO:*** <br>
01. Clean up the code.<br>
02. Add C++11 features.<br>
03. Change that horrible song.<br>
04. Class inheritance structure for enemies and bosses!<br>
